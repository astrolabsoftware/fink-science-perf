## Helpers for profiling

This folder contains scripts profiling fink-science modules.
They should be named as their corresponding fink-science module folder with the `prof_` prefix, e.g.
`prof_random_forest_snia.py` corresponds to [random_forest_snia](https://github.com/astrolabsoftware/fink-science/tree/master/fink_science/random_forest_snia)
